# HTML-CSS-Cheetsheet-Website
Website I built in Codecademy Full Stack Engineering Bootcamp using HTML/CSS

Access the final site here: https://caitlinmalloch.github.io/HTML-CSS-Cheetsheet-Website/

This is a website I built as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Program I am completing. 
I am currently developing my HTML and CSS skills, and this website is a basic build using these new skills. 

To take a look at the program and curriculum I am following to learn to code, check this out: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path.

Cheers!
